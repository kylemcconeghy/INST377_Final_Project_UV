            <h3>Why would we choose to make this project around UV 
                protection and why is it important for us?
            </h3>
            <p1>Many people downplay
                the harmful effects of the sun. In addition, many people forget
                that the easiest way to protect yourself against the sun is to
                put on some sunscreen or even some lotion with SPF in it. 
                Our application aims to help protect you against many of the harmful affects that the sun
                can have on our skin from sunburn to skin cancer. What we hope to accomplish it
                to spread awareness, as well as spark peoples attention to taking 
                care of themselves and their skin for the future.
