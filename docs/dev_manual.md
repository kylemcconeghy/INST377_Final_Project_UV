# Developer Manual for UV Index by Location Application

## To install our application, either clone our github repository to your local device or download each file found within the branch titled "new_branch" seperately through github

## To run our application, first download all of the contents found on our github repository, and then use the "Show in Browser" feature found within VSCode

## The API used for our server application is called OpenUV and it can be found at https://www.openuv.io/dashboard 
## The key we used for our applciation was 'openuv-165a9rlqbc66kl-io'
## Our GET call retrieves the cooresponding UV Index for the inputted location by accessing the UV variable found within the OpenUv Index API(locations on a body of water may not work. Adjust to a location on land and try again)

## In the future we plan to implement a map that users can use to click on to select locations rather than inputting latitude and longitude values
